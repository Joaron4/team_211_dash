#Early Warning Display

This project was developed as part of the training program offered by the government of Colombia through Correlation One, during the 6th Cohort of DS4A training program.

In this project we developed a visual geographical instrument that facilitates the identification of the high risk populations included in the Early Warning as well as the prevalence of specific problematic situations that may violate their rights. The visualizations focus on the communes included in the Early warning namely Norte, Nororiental, San Francisco, Occidental, Garc√≠a Rovira, La Pedregosa, Morrorico, and Mutis, and their respective neighborhoods.
